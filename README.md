    Evidence Management System

PROBLEM STATEMENT
A system for managing evidence is needed that allows all stakeholders—such as police, lawyers, and judges—to securely access data without relying on a central authority, 
reducing the chances of corruption or tampering.

Methods must be implemented in a blockchain-based evidence management system to ensure that once evidence is recorded, it cannot be changed or deleted, 
thus maintaining the trustworthiness of the information during legal cases.

OBJECTIVES

Develop a decentralized evidence management system that provides secure access to all stakeholders, ensuring transparency and accountability without relying on a central authority.

Implement robust authentication and authorization protocols to verify the identity of users accessing the evidence management system, thereby safeguarding against unauthorized access 
and potential corruption.
